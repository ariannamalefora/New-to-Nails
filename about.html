<p class=p1>Although it may appear simple, having great looking nails is a great way to boost your confidence and style. Nails grow from the area under the cuticle, called the matrix. The living part of the nail is called the 'matrix' and the cuticle is the layer of skin that protects it. It is very important for nail strength and growth. The growth of new nail cells in the matrix pushes the older nail cells toward the fingertips and becomes hard.</p>
<p class=p2>Heredity and health are generally the deciding factors on how quickly nails grow. Nails grow about 0.1 millimeter a day. This means that it takes a fingernail approximately four to six months to fully redevelop. Healthy nails are generally smooth and without any cracks or white spots. They are uniform in shade and consistency and are free of any kind of discoloration. Nails generally grow faster in summer than in the winter. It is observed that nails on the dominant hand grow faster. The optimum and practical length of the nails depends on the activities and lifestyle of the person. It is advisable to keep in mind that the nail tip can extend no further than one third of the body of the nail. Nails break less often when they are all of the same length.
<p class=p3>It is very important to keep the nails without nail polish once in a while, so that it allows them to breathe. It is also advisable to keep a hand lotion or cream near the kitchen sink. It is also essential to wear gloves while doing household chores or gardening and rub cream on the hands, before putting on the gloves.
